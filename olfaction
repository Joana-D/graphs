#time score: time spent in odor A during test interval (time_odorA/time_interval)x100%
#decision score: decisions in favor of odor A during test interval; decision=every time fly enters and exits the central choice zone,
#entry into odor A from central choice zone (decisions_odorA/decisions_interval)x100%
#untrained preference: during first odor choice before electric shock
#trained preference: 0% = perfect odor avoidance?
